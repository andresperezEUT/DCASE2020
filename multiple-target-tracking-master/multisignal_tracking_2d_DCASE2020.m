%% Tracking unknown number of 2D targets using Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering 
% 
% Read the documentation in - http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/rbmcda/
% Specifically this script is modified version of - http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/rbmcda/mt_demo.html
%   
% This script reads the frame-wise 2D target location from a CSV file. Each 
% row of the CSV file consists of the time in seconds, and estimated
% location. In this script, as the estimated location, we use the direction 
% of arrival (DOA) of a sound source represented using the azimuth (in 
% 0-360 degree range) and elevation angles (in 0-180 degree range). If more 
% than one source occurs in the same frame, the  consecutive rows will 
% contain the spatial location of each sources with an identical time stamp
%
% The output of the script is the list of DOA tracks in mat file.
% Additionally, this script also visualizes the estimated tracks, and its 
% respective reference. 
%
% For custom setup, you will need to tune PARAMETERS. I have made notes of
% what I have understood of these parameters when tuning myself, and from 
% the original documentation.

                % respective 2D axes. 
                % We are assuming the sources have a mean azimuth and 
                % elevation of 0 and 0 respectively.
                % M0(3, 4) Mean velocity of the sound sources in the 
                % respective 2D axes. 
                % We are assuming the overall velocity average along

    % P0(0, 1) is the variance of the signal along azimuth and elevation.
    % p0(0)= 360 means that the sound sources can exist anywhere in 0:360
    % degrees in azimuth and similarly 0:180 for elevation P(1)
    %
    % P0(2, 3) is the derivative/velocity of the signal in azimuth and 
    % elevation respectively. For example if a sound source moves 50 degrees 
    % in roughly 40 frames( 8 seconds) then P0(2) has to be set to 50/8 = 6

           % same track. Lets say that the gt of the current track is 30 deg
           % and sd is 5, then if the DOA in the next frame is in the range of
           % 30-5 and 30+5 it will be part of the current track.
           % When two sources are very close by, if sd is large it can merge
           % this sources into one, and the final DOA track will be the average
           % of these two tracks.
